# Pomodoro Hero

Hey there! Struggling to stay focused in our age of endless distractions? You're not alone. I created Pomodoro Hero because I was tired of bouncing between browser tabs and getting absolutely nothing done. 

This isn't just another timer app – it's your productivity companion that actually makes the Pomodoro Technique enjoyable. Built with love using Next.js and React, because life's too short for slow, ugly apps.

## What Makes This Special?

Look, I know there are a million timer apps out there. But here's why Pomodoro Hero might just become your new favorite:

- **Timer that bends to your will** – 25 minutes too long? 15 too short? Set whatever works for you
- **Actually useful task tracking** – Not just a fancy to-do list, but one that plays nice with your focus sessions
- **Eye candy that doesn't hurt** – Beautiful, responsive design that won't make your eyes bleed
- **Night owl friendly** – Dark mode that actually looks good (we've all seen those "dark" modes that are just gray, right?)
- **Works everywhere** – Phone, tablet, desktop – it just works
- **See your progress** – Because sometimes you need proof that you're actually getting stuff done
- **Gentle nudges** – Desktop notifications that don't scare you out of your chair
- **Sounds that don't annoy** – Customizable alerts that won't drive you (or your coworkers) crazy
- **Keyboard ninja mode** – Shortcuts for when you're too in the zone to reach for your mouse

## Built With The Good Stuff

I believe in using tools that make development a joy, not a chore:

- **Next.js 14** – Because React is awesome, and Next.js makes it even better
- **TypeScript** – Catching my silly mistakes before you have to deal with them
- **Tailwind CSS** – Making beautiful designs without writing a million CSS classes
- **shadcn/ui** – UI components that actually look professional
- **React Context** – Keeping state management simple
- **Local Storage** – Your data stays with you (for now – cloud sync coming soon!)
- **Vercel** – Deploy and forget, the way it should be

## Want to Try It Out?

### What You'll Need

- Node.js 18 or newer (seriously, upgrade if you haven't – it's worth it!)
- npm or yarn (pick your poison, both work great)

## How to Actually Use This Thing

Using Pomodoro Hero is refreshingly simple:

1. **Set Your Timer** – Start with 25 minutes if you're new to this, but feel free to experiment
2. **Brain dump your tasks** – Get everything out of your head and into the app
3. **Hit that start button** – Or just smash the spacebar like I do
4. **Work without guilt** – Seriously, close those other tabs
5. **Enjoy your break** – You earned it! The app will tell you when it's time to get back to work
6. **Marvel at your stats** – Watch your productivity patterns emerge over time

## Shortcuts for the Keyboard Warriors

Because reaching for the mouse breaks your flow:

- `Space` – Start/pause (the most important one!)
- `Esc` – Reset when you need a fresh start
- `Ctrl/Cmd + D` – Toggle dark mode (for your vampire hours)
- `Ctrl/Cmd + B` – Jump into break mode
- `Ctrl/Cmd + ,` – Settings (where the magic happens)

## Want to Make It Even Better?

I'd love your help! This started as a personal project, but the best software is built by communities. Here's how you can jump in:

1. **Fork it** – Make it your own playground
2. **Create a branch** – `git checkout -b feature/YourAwesomeIdea`
3. **Make magic happen** – Write some code, fix a bug, improve the docs
4. **Commit with style** – `git commit -m 'Add mind-blowing feature'`
5. **Share the love** – `git push origin feature/YourAwesomeIdea`
6. **Open a Pull Request** – Tell me what you built!

Just keep the code clean and the tests passing – we're all friends here, but let's keep things professional.
